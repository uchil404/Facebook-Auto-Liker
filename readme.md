A very simple and hacky Image AutoLiker Bot for Facebook.
Uses PyAutoGui extensively.
User needs to be logged into their account, and first image should be opened up. This state should be immediately switched to script runner[such as  CMD/PyCharm] (using alt-tab).
Number of images is specified inside the script itself.
The image [likeButtonOn FB] is unique for each monitor, take your own screen shot and replace with file present.


Ideas for betterment will be highly appreciated.
